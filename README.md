# address-autocomplete
A tool to autocomplete valid New Orleans addresses in html forms

This tool will pull addresses from [data.nola.gov](https://data.nola.gov/Geographic-Base-Layers/Addresses/s4ns-ak5d) and build a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) that can be used to autocomplete addresses.
